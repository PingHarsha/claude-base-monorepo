## Current focus
Establishing the development workflow tooling (slash commands, lint, coverage, integration test profile) before building product features.

## Decisions
_Append-only log of meaningful technical decisions and the reasoning behind them._

- _(none yet — workflow tooling is the only completed work so far)_

## Open questions
_Things we haven't resolved. Move resolved ones into Decisions._

- _(none yet)_

## Changelog
_Short bullet per `/ship`, newest first. Format: `YYYY-MM-DD — <summary>`_

- 2026-05-13 — Established v2 workflow tooling: slash commands (`/plan-feature`, `/ship`, `/verify`, `/merge`, `/integration-verify`, `/promote`, `/address-review`, `/quickfix`), Spotless lint (Google Java Format AOSP), JaCoCo coverage check at 80%, `integration-tests` Maven profile, README.md. Workflow shared via `.claude/` (commands, hook script, project settings.json); `.claude/settings.local.json` stays gitignored.
